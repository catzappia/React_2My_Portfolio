# React_2My_Portfolio
a portfolio created with React. 

## Description

- this took me a while to get right and a lot of trial and error when it comes to deploying to netlify.
- I am only a little sad that the font I picked didn't carry over to deployment.

## Features

a vite+react app that contains an about me section (home), my project portfolio, a contact form, and my resume.
Its deployed via Netlify. 
If you made it this far, the missing font was "baloo".
